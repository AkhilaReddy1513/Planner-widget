They can set time goals for individual tasks and measure their performance against those goals. This feature promotes effective time management and ensures that users stay on track with their planned activities.

Time Awareness: The Stopwatch Widget raises awareness of how time is spent throughout the day. It helps users identify time-consuming activities or areas where they may be wasting time. By having a clear understanding of how time is utilized, users can make adjustments to their routines and allocate time more effectively.
